# Dilhi Humidity Forecasting with Arima and prophet, Time Series Analysis.

# About the project:

In this notebook, I analyze weather data collected in Delhi over a period of four years (2013-2017) to forecast humidity levels for the next eight months (32 weeks). I explore each feature over time and conduct time series decomposition to extract valuable insights. 

To perform a univariate forecast, I test for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and feed the feature to ARIMA. Additionally, I use Prophet to perform a multivariate forecast.
